# When to close the position?

## Options

* Close when another major narrative appears
* Close when support breaks
  * And Darvas used it
  * The chart patterns still repeat, though they have been discovered a long time ago
* Close according to risk management rules (?)

## Notes

* Should close at the peak of expectations
* It's not necessary to close if the narrative will reset (e.g. Bitcoin had multiple bear markets)
  * It's better to close, especially because we don't know whether the narrative will reset
