# Supply & Demand

Hypothesis: government regulations that influence the supply-demand balance are the source of viral narratives.

Supports:

* Government announcement are "trusted sources"
* Obvious supply-demand changes produce simple narratives

Examples:

* BTCUSD bottom was on 2020-03-13
  * Fed announced that it was going to print USD on 2020-03-23 (10 days later)
    * BTCUSD showed only a minor spike on the announcement
* USDRUB top was on 2022-03-07
  * CBRF is going to increase the key rate to 20% on 2022-02-28 (7 days earlier)
  * Putin mandated that the exporters must sell 80% of foreign currency income into RUB on 2022-02-28 (7 days earlier)

Hypothesis: we need to wait until the formation of the meme

* SPX reacted to COVID-19 with delay
* BTCUSD reacted to Fed Print with delay
* USDRUB reacted to CBRF hike to 20% with delay (and most likely there were other factors, too)

Notes:

* Reversals are the results of multiple active narratives (a superposition: some people trading based on old narrative, some people trading based on new narrative)
* Some processes can be predicted to run its course. Maybe we can predict the running of the narrative? (this gets us back to "criticality")
  * Examples
    * Fire
    * Nuclear reaction
    * Avalanche ("snowball effect")
* A narrative can be "replaced" by another narrative
* Each hit of the narrative has a non-zero probability of converting a person, who then becomes a transmitter of the narrative
  * That's why the rate of conversion is fastest at the end of the trend

## Strategy

* Get sources
  * Options
    * Get official sources
    * Get individuals with high reputation
    * Get news aggregators
* For each news
  * If the news can influence the circulating supply:
    * Options
      * Wait for memes to form
      * Trade right away
    * Notes
      * Trading right away is suboptimal, because some ranges were violated after the trendsetting event
      * It's fundamentally impossible to know how many people have already traded according to the narrative
* Calculate the current speed of spread (num occurrences in current period / num occurrences in previous period).
  If the meme is spreading “fast enough” (needs better definition), then check the meme for believability.
  If the meme is believable, then check the meme for non-exhaustiveness of reach (there must still be reachable people who have not bought yet).
  If all conditions pass, then buy.

## Questions

* How to resolve a situation with conflicting narratives?
  * Notes
    * There are always conflicting narratives on a single asset
* Get a market model
  * Get an existing market model
    * Options
      * CLOB (Central Limit Order Book)
      * Liquidity pool
  * Get a new market model
    * A generalization of CLOB & LP
