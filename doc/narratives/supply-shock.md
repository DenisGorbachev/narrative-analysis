# Supply shock

The "supply shock" narrative is the simplest and the most believable: a dramatic, unexpected change of supply. It rapidly spreads through the population precisely because it's easy to understand (there are no formulas, just the fact that the new supply is much higher than the old supply).

Examples:

* Oil supply shock in 1979
* USD supply shock in 2020 (COVID relief package)
* Wheat supply shock in 2022 (Russia-Ukraine war)

A supply shock directly affects the future price.
