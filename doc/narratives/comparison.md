# Comparison

The "comparison" narrative is also simple & believable. This narrative compares two assets, and draws a conclusion that asset A is more valuable than asset B, but currently has a lower market cap. Therefore, you should long asset A & short asset B. Examples:

* Buy Bitcoin against gold because:
  * Bitcoin is more valuable than gold, but its market cap is lower than gold market cap:
    * You can transfer Bitcoin quickly to anyone in the world.
    * You can't transfer gold quickly to anyone in the world.
    * The ability to transfer something quickly increases its stashed supply.
* Buy Uniswap tokens against Chicago Mercantile Exchange shares because:
  * Uniswap is more valuable than Chicago Mercantile Exchange, but its market cap is lower than CME market cap:
    * More people want to trade tokens than stocks (questionable; must be an assumption).
    * ... (the narrative requires too many assumptions to become believable, which reduces its simplicity)

The general template is:

* "Buy asset A against asset B, because asset A is more valuable than asset B, but the market cap of asset A is lower than the market cap of asset B" (accompanied by logical derivation).

A "comparison" narrative is harder to understand than a "[supply shock](supply-shock.md)" narrative because it requires more assumptions to prove that asset A is more valuable than asset B. Also, the "comparison" narrative requires two trades (long asset A & short asset B) in the most common case where two assets aren't traded against each other directly. Therefore, such narrative has a low probability of becoming the primary one.
