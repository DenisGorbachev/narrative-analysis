# Narrative Analysis Drafts

Goal: produce a policy for making investments.

Implementation:

* Prove that a chain reaction has happened
* Prove that there is enough fuel

Useful principles:

* Schelling point: people can make similar decisions independently if they know that they need to make similar decisions
* Chain reaction (aka reflexivity): a narrative influences the actions, then the actions become a new narrative
  * Examples
    * MacroStrategy buying Bitcoin
* Out of two futures, the one with least required energy is more likely

## Explanation of "price will move if traders believe the price will move"

* We know that the price will move only if someone makes a trade.
* Someone will make a trade if they believe they will be able to make another trade (to close their position) in the future at a better price.
* Therefore, the price will move if someone believes that the price will move.

## Narrative format

Different narratives have different formats. We need to convert them to a single format to apply our analysis. We propose to convert every narrative to a set of statements about the future distribution of supply ([see why](definitions.md#supply)):

* "Bitcoin will replace fiat" -> "There will be more unique holders of Bitcoin than fiat"
* "Ethereum will become more valuable after the PoS transition" -> (multiple statements)
  * Some holders will stake ETH to get more ETH
  * ETH free supply will decrease
    * Note: "free supply" is defined as ETH that is simply held on a wallet & can be sold anytime.
* "Dogecoin to the moon!" -> "Free supply of Dogecoin will decrease"
