# The Big Short, analyzed

Michael Burry created a new narrative: "Buy credit default swaps on mortgage-backed securities because the borrowers won't be able to pay back the credits". His reasoning was simple:

1. A lot of people took mortgages (loans to buy houses).
2. Some people don't have the income necessary to pay back the mortgages.
3. These people won't be able to sell the houses if the prices fall (they will still have to pay back the mortgages).
4. The banks gave mortgages to people who couldn't pay them back.
5. When it becomes known that most mortgages won't be paid back, the mortgage-backed securities will go down in price.
6. Credit default swaps allow the holder to receive a certain amount of money if the credit default happens (= mortgages are not paid back).

Michael Burry created the narrative based on fundamentals. He extrapolated the current data & concluded that delinquency rates will go up, which will trigger defaults on mortgage-backed securities.
