# Primary narrative

How to determine what narrative becomes the primary one?

The question is irrelevant, because the narratives arrive randomly in time.

## Drafts

* Every person can make money if:
  * They act upon the same narrative that others will act upon in future ("vote with majority")
  * They open a position earlier than others ("be fast")
* Every person can make more money if they buy into a new narrative instead of the old one
* Every person has a direct incentive to spread the narrative if he has already bought
  * If the person buys, he will have a higher probability of spreading the narrative.
* Every person hold a finite amount of narratives in his memory
  * Reading a new narrative requires time
  * Personal time is finite
* Every person has an "activation threshold" - they act upon a narrative only if it is "strong" enough
  * Some people will not act at all

## Notes

* Some strong trends start with unexpected events
  * Bitcoin is created
  * COVID-19 first cases reported in US
  * Fed approved a COVID relief package (printed USD)
  * Fed approved a bailout for the banks
    * First proposal submitted on 19-09-2008
      * SPX rose by 3%
    * Second House voted yes on 03-10-2008
    * Nasdaq100 bottomed on 21-11-2008 (1.5 months later)
    * SPX bottomed on 06-03-2009 (6 months later)
    * Why did the market bottom long after the bailout news?
      * Notes
        * "Protests opposing the bailout occurred in over 100 cities across the United States on Thursday September 25"
      * Options
        * The bailout USD supply was targeted at mortgage-backed securities, not at stocks
          * But the COVID relief USD supply was not targeted at stocks as well (?)
        * The bailout USD supply was not deemed sufficient to buy out all troubled MBSes
        * The meme didn't form
        * Traders didn't believe that the money will actually be used (?)
  * Russia invaded Ukraine on 2022-02-24
    * Wheat futures were already going up on rumors
    * Wheat futures went up after announcement
    * Wheat futures peaked on 2022-03-08 (12 days later)
* Company shares narratives are results of multiple "stable changes": people decide to change their habits (e.g. start using Facebook, Stripe, Uniswap)
  * The question of a sticky habit is equal to the question of "product-market fit"
