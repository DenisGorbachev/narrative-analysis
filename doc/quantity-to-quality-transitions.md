# Quantity-to-Quality transitions

* We want to make money
* We want to increase our buying power
* We want to hold assets with increasing buying power

We can hold the assets if we buy them from other people. Other people will sell them for a lower price if they have a different model of the world (in which those assets don't have increasing buying power).

We need to react quickly to structural changes in the world (changes to ordered supply function). However, for some structural changes, there is no obvious way from change to change of supply equation. For example:

* There's no obvious way from "Uniswap is deployed" to "Uniswap liquidity will become higher than Binance liquidity".
* ...

However, we can listen to quantitative changes to trigger a re-examination of the change (spend more time looking for a way from change to "another change").

Some quantitative changes trigger qualitative changes. Examples:

* Energy price in Europe increases by 10x -> Some factories become unprofitable

A qualitative change triggers a quantitative change, which may trigger another qualitative change. The equilibrium may be reached, but only if given enough time without a new qualitative change.

Example of event chains:

* Russia invades Ukraine
* Germany stops buying Russian gas
* Energy prices in Germany go up 10x
* Some factories in Germany become unprofitable
* Some factories in Germany fire the employees (?)
* Germany GDP decreases (?)
* ... ?
